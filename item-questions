QUESTIONS ABOUT ITEMS
- can drugs be used in battle?  I assume no
- I think: key items are uncountable.  everything else is countable.  an item can be held iff it is countable.
- what do shoal salt/shell do?  I know you can trade them to someone
- how do black/white flute work exactly...?  can they be used in battle?  I assume no
- check bp for ultimate held item ref or something
