90,Poison Heal,4,"If this Pokémon is :mechanic:`poisoned` or :mechanic:`badly poisoned`, it will heal for 1/8 of its maximum :mechanic:`HP` after each turn rather than taking damage.

96,Normalize,4,"This Pokémon's moves all act as if they were :type:`Normal`\ -type.

Moves that inflict :mechanic:`typeless damage` do so as usual.  Moves of variable type, such as :move:`Hidden Power` and :move:`Judgement`, are affected, but otherwise work as usual; for example, :move:`Weather Ball` has doubled power and looks different during :mechanic:`weather`, but is always Normal.

A :move:`Will-O-Wisp` turned Normal by this ability can affect :type:`Ghost`\ -type Pokémon, despite otherwise acting like a Normal move.  (This is specific to Will-O-Wisp; other status moves do not have this quirk.)",Makes the Pokémon's moves all act as :type:`Normal` moves.

For example, this Pokémon takes no damage from from :mechanic:`weather`, recoil, :mechanic:`status ailments`, or :mechanic:`Spikes`, but it still suffers from the :mechanic:`Attack` cut when :mechanic:`burned`, and a :item:`Life Orb` will still power up this Pokémon's moves without damaging it.  Anything that depends on such damage will also not happen; for example, :move:`Leech Seed` will neither hurt this Pokémon nor heal the opponent, and Pokémon with a :item:`Jaboca Berry` or :item:`Rowap Berry` will not consume the berry when hit by this Pokémon.

Also, :mechanic:`paralysis` cannot prevent this Pokémon from moving, though the :mechanic:`Speed` cut is unaffected.

:move:`Struggle`\ 's recoil, the :mechanic:`HP` costs of :move:`Belly Drum` and :move:`Substitute`, and :move:`Pain Split`, whether used by or against this Pokémon, are unaffected.

If this Pokémon is :mechanic:`badly poisoned`, the poison counter is still increased each turn; if the Pokémon loses this ability, it will begin taking as much damage as it would be if it had been taking increasing damage each turn.

99,No Guard,4,"Moves used by or against this Pokémon never miss.

One-hit KO moves are unaffected.  Moves affected by this ability can hit Pokémon during the preparation turn of moves like :move:`Dig` or :move:`Fly`.

102,Leaf Guard,4,"This Pokémon cannot be given a :mechanic:`major status ailment` during :mechanic:`strong sunlight`.

If an ability could either hinder or help this Pokémon's moves, e.g. :ability:`Dry Skin` or :ability:`Unaware`, the ability will be ignored either way.

An ability ignored by this ability is only nullified for the duration of the move; for example, this Pokémon's moves can :mechanic:`paralyze` a Pokémon with :ability:`Limber`, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon's :move:`Spikes` are not affected by this ability after they have been placed.

This ablity does not in any way ignore type changes granted by abilities such as :ability:`Color Change` or :ability:`Forecast`; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the :mechanic:`paralysis` from :ability:`Static` or the rain from :ability:`Drizzle`; nor abilities that only hinder moves' effects on the *user*, such as :ability:`Liquid Ooze`.

The weather abilities respect :mechanic:`Speed`.  If multiple Pokémon with this ability, :ability:`Drizzle`, :ability:`Sand Stream`, or :ability:`Snow Warning` are sent out at the same time, each will take effect and be cancelled by the next, and only the slowest Pokémon's ability—or the fastest during :move:`Trick Room`—will have its weather stay.",Summons :mechanic:`hail` upon entering battle.
