For example, this Pokémon takes no damage from from [weather]{mechanic}, recoil, [status ailments]{mechanic}, or [Spikes]{move}, but it still suffers from the [Attack]{mechanic} cut when [burned]{mechanic:burn}, and a [Life Orb]{item} will still power up this Pokémon's moves without damaging it.  Anything that directly depends on such damage will also not happen; for example, [Leech Seed]{move} will neither hurt this Pokémon nor heal the opponent, and Pokémon with a [Jaboca Berry]{item} or [Rowap Berry]{item} will not consume the berry when hit by this Pokémon.

Also, [paralysis]{mechanic} cannot prevent this Pokémon from moving, though the [Speed]{mechanic} cut is unaffected.

[Struggle]{move}'s recoil; [Pain Split]{move}, whether used by or against this Pokémon; and the [HP]{mechanic} costs of [Belly Drum]{move} and [Substitute]{move} are unaffected.

If an ability could either hinder or help this Pokémon's moves, e.g. [Dry Skin]{ability} or [Unaware]{ability}, the ability is ignored either way.

An ability ignored by this ability is only nullified for the duration of the move.  For example, this Pokémon's moves can [paralyze]{mechanic:paralysis} a Pokémon with [Limber]{ability}, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon's [Spikes]{move} are not helped by this ability after they have been placed.

This ablity does not in any way ignore type changes granted by abilities such as [Color Change]{ability} or [Forecast]{ability}; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from [Drizzle]{ability}; nor abilities that hinder moves' effects on the user but not the target, such as [Liquid Ooze]{ability}.

This Pokémon's held item, whether or not it is a Plate, cannot be taken by [Covet]{move} or [Thief]{move}, nor removed by [Knock Off]{move}, nor traded by [Switcheroo]{move} or [Trick]{move}.  Covet, Thief, and Knock Off still inflict damage against this Pokémon.  Unlike with [Sticky Hold]{ability}, this Pokémon cannot use [Fling]{move}, Switcheroo, or Trick to lose its item itself, nor gain an item through Switcheroo or Trick if it does not have one.

This ability has no effect for any Pokémon other than [Arceus]{pokemon}.
