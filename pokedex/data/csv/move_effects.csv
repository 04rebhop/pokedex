80,"Transfers 1/4 of the user's max HP into a doll, protecting the user from further damage or status changes until it breaks.","Transfers 1/4 the user's max [HP]{mechanic} into a doll that absorbs damage and causes most negative move effects to fail.  If the user leaves the [field]{mechanic}, the doll will vanish.  If the user cannot pay the [HP]{mechanic} cost, this move will fail.

The doll takes damage as normal, using the user's stats and types, and will break when its [HP]{mechanic} reaches zero.  Self-inflicted damage from [confusion]{mechanic} or recoil is not absorbed.  Healing effects from opponents ignore the doll and heal the user as normal.  Moves that work based on the user's [HP]{mechanic} still do so; the doll's [HP]{mechanic} does not influence any move.

The doll will block [major status effect]{mechanic}s, [confusion]{mechanic}, and [flinch]{mechanic}ing.  The effects of [Smellingsalt]{move} and [Wake-up Slap]{move} do not trigger against a doll, even if the Pokémon behind the doll has the appropriate [major status effect]{mechanic}.  Multi-turn trapping moves like [Wrap]{move} will hit the doll for their [regular damage]{mechanic}, but the multi-turn trapping and damage effects will not activate.

Moves blocked or damage absorbed by the doll do not count as hitting the user or inflicting damage for any effects that respond to such, e.g., [Avalanche]{move}, [Counter]{move}, or a [Rowap Berry]{item}.  [Magic Coat]{move} still works as normal, even against moves the doll would block.  Opposing Pokémon that damage the doll with a leech move like [Absorb]{move} are healed as normal.

A Pokémon affected by [Yawn]{move} before summoning the doll will still fall to [sleep]{mechanic}.

The doll blocks [Intimidate]{ability}, but all other abilities act as though the doll did not exist.  If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for [HP]{mechanic} (such as [Volt Absorb]{ability} absorbing [Thunder Wave]{move}), such moves will not be blocked.

[Life Orb]{item} and berries that cause [confusion]{mechanic} still work as normal, but their respective [HP]{mechanic} loss and [confusion]{mechanic} are absorbed/blocked by the doll.

The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the [field]{mechanic}, such as by [Pursuit]{move} or [Spikes]{move}; however, the doll will block the [poison]{mechanic} effect of [Toxic Spikes]{move}.

The doll is passed on by [Baton Pass]{move}.  It keeps its existing [HP]{mechanic}, but uses the replacement Pokémon's stats and types for damage calculation.

All other effects work as normal."

91,Forces the target to repeat its last used move every turn for 2 to 6 turns.,"The next 4–8 times (selected at random) the target attempts to move, it is forced to repeat its last used move.  If the selected move allows the trainer to select a target, an opponent will be selected at random each turn.  If the target is prevented from using the selected move by some other effect, [Struggle]{move} will be used instead.  This effect ends if the selected move runs out of [PP]{mechanic}.

If the target hasn't used a move since entering the [field]{mechanic}, if it tried to use a move this turn and [failed]{mechanic}, if it does not know the selected move, or if the selected move has 0 [PP]{mechanic} remaining, this move will fail.  If the target's last used move was [Encore]{move}, [Mimic]{move}, [Mirror Move]{move}, [Sketch]{move}, [Struggle]{move}, or [Transform]{move}, this move will fail."
92,Sets the user's and targets's HP to the average of their current HP.,"Changes the user's and target's remaining [HP]{mechanic} to the average of their current remaining [HP]{mechanic}.  Ignores [accuracy]{mechanic} and [evasion]{mechanic} modifiers.  This effect does not count as inflicting damage for other moves and effects that respond to damage taken.

94,Changes the user's type to a random type either resistant or immune to the last move used against it.,"Changes the user's type to a type either resistant or immune to the last damaging move that hit it.  The new type is selected at random and cannot be a type the user already is.  If there is no eligible new type, this move will fail."
95,Ensures that the user's next move will hit the target.,"If the user targets the same target again before the end of the next turn, the move it uses is guaranteed to hit.  This move itself also ignores [accuracy]{mechanic} and [evasion]{mechanic} modifiers.

One-hit KO moves are also guaranteed to hit, as long as the user is equal or higher level than the target.  This effect also allows the user to hit Pokémon that are off the field due to moves such as [Dig]{move} or [Fly]{move}.

(Bit 1 is 1 if the [IV]{mechanic} is of the form `4n + 2` or `4n + 3`.  `x` is then 64 * [Special Defense]{mechanic} [IV]{mechanic} bit 1, plus 32 * [Special Attack]{mechanic} [IV]{mechanic} bit 1, etc.)
