A Pokémon affected by [Yawn]{move:yawn} before summoning the doll will still fall to [sleep]{mechanic:sleep}.

If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for [HP]{mechanic:hp} (such as [Volt Absorb]{ability:volt-absorb} absorbing [Thunder Wave]{move:thunder-wave}), such moves will not be blocked.

[Life Orb]{item:life-orb} and berries that cause [confusion]{mechanic:confusion} still work as normal, but their respective [HP]{mechanic:hp} loss and [confusion]{mechanic:confusion} are absorbed/blocked by the doll.

The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the [field]{mechanic:field}, such as by [Pursuit]{move:pursuit} or [Spikes]{move:spikes}; however, the doll will block the [poison]{mechanic:poison} effect of [Toxic Spikes]{move:toxic-spikes}.
