"""Quick, dirty script that will convert a csv file to yaml, spawn an editor
for you to fiddle with it, then convert back to csv and replace the original
file.

Run me as: $0 some_file.csv

The editor used is $EDITOR, of course.

This script is not guaranteed to be even remotely reliable, so consider only
using it on files in source control.
